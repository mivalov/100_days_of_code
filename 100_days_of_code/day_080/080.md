# Challenge for Day 80

## Incoming

Go and grab your login form code from yesterday.

Connect it up to Flask.

Make it work.

There should be:

1. Three valid username & password combos.
2. A 'nice' page for valid users.
3. A hideous naughty step of a page for non-valid users/attempted hackers.

### Example:

![example 1](example1.png)

![example 2](example2.png)

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Use a dictionary to store the valid usernames and passwords.
> - Use a Boolean variable to store whether a valid combo is present in the dictionary or not.
> - Use `try .... except` to login.
