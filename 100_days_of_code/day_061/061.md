# Challenge for Day 61

Someone is wrong on the Internet!
Today, we're going to fix the major malfunction with social media - other people and their stupid opinions- and create a Twitter for one!

## Twitter

I know you like to hear the sound of your own voice!

Your program should.

1. Display a menu - Add or View tweets.
2. 'Add' should:
    - Get the tweet input.
    - Store it to the database with the current timestamp as the key value.
3. 'View' should:
    - Show the tweets in reverse chronological order.
    - Show 10 tweets at a time.
    - Prompt the user to show another 10 tweets (yes or no).
    - A 'no' choice goes back to the menu.

Timestamp Code:

```python
import datetime

timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
```

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Use the `datetime` library to get the current timestamp.
> - Use the `os` library to clear the console between each 10 tweets shown.
