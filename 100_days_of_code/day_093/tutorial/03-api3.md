# Access Token

ðŸ‘‰ Back to Spotify now, and let's search for an artist. Copy your access token (you may need to print it out again) and paste it into the **OAuthToken** box in Spotify. Then click **request**.

## Fill in the details

ðŸ‘‰ Now fill in the rest of the details in the Spotify search menu. You can see lots of examples of what to search for on the [API reference page](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/search). Then click **Try It** and scroll down to see the JSON on the right of the screen.

## Grab part of the query
ðŸ‘‰ Next I'm going to grab part of the query from the Spotify page and bring it into a variable in my Repl. The part that I've grabbed specifies that I'm searching for tracks by 'Queen', and I only want to display 5 results.
![](resources/02_api4.png)
```python
search = "?q=artist%3Aqueen&type=track&limit=5"
```
## The full query
Next, create the full query by concatenating the `url` and `search` variables.  I've included the full code here. The new line is the last one.

```python
import requests, json, os
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

clientID = os.environ['CLIENT_ID']
clientSecret = os.environ['CLIENT_SECRET']

url = "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token"
data = {"grant_type":"client_credentials"}
auth = HTTPBasicAuth(clientID, clientSecret)

response = requests.post(url, data=data, auth=auth)

accessToken = response.json()["access_token"]

url = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/search"
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {accessToken}'}
search = "?q=artist%3Aqueen&type=track&limit=5"

fullURL = f"{url}{search}"
```

ðŸ‘‰ At last! Time to send that url off and get some results from it.  I also need to send the headers to get authorization.

I've also used a loop to strip out just the track names and output them.
## Preview the song
Spotify also includes a cool *preview URL* - a 30 second sample of the song, so I've added a link to that sample as part of the output.

```python
response = requests.get(fullURL, headers=headers)

for track in data["tracks"]["items"]:
  print(track["name"])
  
```
## Making this customizable
ðŸ‘‰So how about making our search user customizable?
In the code below, I have:
- Asked the user to input an artist (line 14)
- Tidied up their input (line 15)
- formatted the `search` URL as an fString that includes the artist (line 19)
  
Here's the code:

```python
import requests, json, os
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

clientID = os.environ['CLIENT_ID']
clientSecret = os.environ['CLIENT_SECRET']

url = "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token"
data = {"grant_type":"client_credentials"}
auth = HTTPBasicAuth(clientID, clientSecret)

response = requests.post(url, data=data, auth=auth)
accessToken = response.json()["access_token"]

artist = input("Artist: ").lower()
artist = artist.replace(" ", "%20")

url = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/search"
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {accessToken}'}
search = f"?q=artist%3A{artist}&type=track&limit=5"

fullURL = f"{url}{search}"

response = requests.get(fullURL, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))  

for track in data["tracks"]["items"]:
  print(track["name"])
  print(track["preview_url"])

```
