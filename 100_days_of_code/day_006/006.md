# Challenge for Day 6

## Make your own login program:

1. Create a program where someone logins with their username and password correctly and then gets a lovely individual greeting.
    > Hint: Remember the word `and` to make sure the username AND password are correct.
2. Write a specific personalised greeting for 3 different people.
3. Don't forget an `else` statement for everyone else who shouldn't be logging in.
