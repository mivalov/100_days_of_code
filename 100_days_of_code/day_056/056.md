# Challenge for day 56

I've included a csv file ('100MostStreamedSongs.csv') in this repl that contains data from a music streaming service.

## Music Streaming Service

Your program should:

1. Read in the data.
2. Categorize the songs by artist, like this:
    - Create one empty folder per artist.
    - Create one blank text file per song by that artist in the relevant folder. The file name of the text file should be the name of the song.

> ðŸ’¡ Hints
> - For each artist, check the directory to see if they already have a folder. If they do, use it. If not, create it.
