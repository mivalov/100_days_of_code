# Challenge for Day 88

## Authentication fines

Today's challenge is to adapt your blog engine again.

Your program should:

1. Allow your normal blog page to be visible to anyone, regardless of login status.
2. If a user logs in, and it's you, take them to the admin page.
3. If a user logs in, and it's not you, tell them off for being naughty!

### Example

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - To check if the user is you or not (this is a generic user ID), use

```python
  user_id = request.headers['X-Replit-User-Id']
  if user_id != "13197838":
      return redirect("/")
```
