# Challenge for Day 4

Everyone loves a good story!

Well, you're going to create your own adventure story that places your _user_ in the role of the main character, and we'll even customise the story to suit their interests.

## You will need to do:

1. Ask your users to list a bunch of information about them:
    - things they like
    - things they hate
    - names of family and friends ...
It is up to you how many and what kinds of things you pick. Keep it wacky!
    > Hint: Think about variables and `input`.
2. Now construct your story - it can be about anything you want, but must use the variables you've created in step 1.
    > Hint: Remember concatenation and the use of `,` and `""`.
3. Make sure to only work one paragraph at a time. Otherwise, things could get a **bit messy**.

## Colour Table

| Colour  | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default | 0     |
| Black   | 30    |
| Red     | 31    |
| Green   | 32    |
| Yellow  | 33    |
| Blue    | 34    |
| Purple  | 35    |
| Cyan    | 36    |
| White   | 37    |

```python
# example use of coloured text
print('\033[32mHello World\033[0m')
```

## Example

Everything which is within the curly braces `{...}` is what you need to ask the user, store it in a variable and then display that in your story.

```text
Welcome to your adventure simulator. I am going to ask you a bunch of questions and then create an epic story with you as the star!

What is your name?
What is your worst enemy’s name?
What is your superpower?
Where do you live?
What is your favorite food?

Hello {name}! Your ability to {superpower} will make sure you never have to look at {worst enemy’s name} again. Go eat {your favorite food} as you walk down the streets of {where you live} and use {superpower} for good and not evil!
```
