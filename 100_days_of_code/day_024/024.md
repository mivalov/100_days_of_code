# Challenge for Day 24

## Functions with parameters

Let's build an infinity dice!

- Create subroutines that will roll a dice with any number of sides (essentially as big of a number as you like). Write one function with one parameter that allows us to call a function (such as roll_dice).

### Example

```text
Example:

Infinity Dice 🎲

How many sides?: 600
You rolled 532

Roll again? yes
You rolled 102

Roll again? no
```

> Hints:
> - Import your library first
> - Create a variable to ask the user how many sides the dice should be.
> - Create a variable that allows the user to leave the game.
> - Create a function with roll_dice that sets the sides of the dice as the argument.
> - Create a `while` loop that allows the user to roll again or leave the game.`
