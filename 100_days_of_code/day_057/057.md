# Challenge for Day 57

## Recursion

Try to use recursion to build a factorial program.

Yep, it's a math challenge. Recursion is often good for this type of problem.

It could be a real head scratcher, so don't be afraid to use [100 Days of Code Community](https://replit.com/100-days-code) or the [Discord channel](https://replit.com/discord) for help.

A factorial is the product of all the numbers up to a value, starting from 1.

For example, factorial 5 would be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

1. Write a function that:
   - Starts at the highest number.
   - Multiplies that by factorial of itself minus one
   - Terminates when it reaches 1 and returns 1
   - Outputs the factorial.

### Example

```text

Input a number > 5

The factorial of 5 is 120.
```

> 💡 Hints:
> - Don't forget to return 1 in your terminating condition.
> - Try multiplying the number by the factorial (n-1) call.
