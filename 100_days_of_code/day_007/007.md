# Challenge for Day 7

## Fake Fan Question Generator

Want to find out if someone else is a true super fan of the same show, movie or interest as you? Create a program that asks what someone is interested in and includes nested if statements to ask annoying follow-up questions to see if someone is the real deal!

Make sure you include multiple if/elif statements and nested if statements too!

> Hint: The code from today is a good place to get you started.

## Example:

```text
Fake Fan Finder
---------------
What's your favourite Anime?
One Piece

Oh really?! Name me any of the characters?
Nami

You got that by pure chance. Okay then, what is her job on the ship?
Navigator

Hmph! What was her first bounty then?
Ummm...

See! Fake One piece fan!
