# Challenge for Day 71

## Login System (Part 2)

Today's challenge is to build a simple login system.

Your program should:

1. Display a menu with the ability to add a user or login.
2. 'Add' user should:
   - Ask for a username and password.
   - Create a new password and a randomly generated 4 digit salt.
   - Append the salt to the password and hash it.
   - Store the hash and the salt in a repl db with the username as the key.
3. 'Login' should:
   - Get username and password input.
   - Display a success message if details are correct.
4. This system should work with multiple users.

### Example:

```text
ðŸŒŸLogin SystemðŸŒŸ

1: Add User, 2: Login >  1

Username: > Kenny
Password: > L0gg1ns

Details stored.

1: Add User, 2: Login >  2

Username: > Kenny
Password: > L0gg1ns

Login successful
```

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Try implementing the two menu options as subroutines. You'll be able to port them to other programs more easily.
