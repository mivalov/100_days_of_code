  <h2>Day 39 Solution</h2>
  <p>The challenge for day 39 was to build a game called "Hangman". It was a tricky project, mostly because of the game logic. I added an extra feature to print out the remaining lives in addition to the ascii representation of the game being displayed in the console. </p>
