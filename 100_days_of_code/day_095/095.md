# Challenge for Day 95

## API Mashup (Part2) - Daily Track Generator

Today's challenge is to create a daily track generator.

Your program should:

1. Pull in 5 of the most recent news stories in your area. (You could also specify a category here to avoid all the depressing stuff out there.)
2. Ask openai to summarise each story in two to three words.
3. Pass those words to Spotify in a search. Show and give a sample of each song.
4. No need to build this in Flask today. A command line program is just fine. The console should display:
   - The name of each track (five tracks)
   - The prompt words used for the search
   - The URL to get the sample

### Example

> - Don't forget your secrets.
> - You can ask openai to summarize in pretty much plain text. Try this `prompt = (f"""Summarize {article["url"]} in no more than four words.""")`
