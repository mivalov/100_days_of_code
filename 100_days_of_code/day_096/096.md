# Challenge for Day 96

## Let's get scraping

Today's challenge is to go and scrape the headlines from hacker news.

Your program should:

- Only display headlines that at least include the words Python and Replit.

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Use a `for` loop to search through all the headlines.
> - Use an `if` to check each headline for the key terms.
