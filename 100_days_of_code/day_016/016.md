# Challenge for Day 16

## Endless Loop

Create a "Name the Lyrics" game. Write your favourite song lyrics with a word or two missing.
The user has to figure out the correct song lyric in a few attempts as possible. Find the true lyric master among you!

### Example:

```text
Fill in the blank lyrics!
(Type in the blank lyrics and see if you are as cool as me.)

Never going to ______ you up.
put
Nope, try again.

Never going to ______ you up.
let
Nope, try again.

Never going to ______ you up.
give

Well done! It only took you 3 attempts.
```

> Hint:
> - Think of your `while True` loop as a replacement for the `if` statement.
> - Place your `break` after the code identifying the correct lyric answer.
