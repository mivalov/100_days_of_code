## Simple GUI Calculator

Your program should:

1. Have buttons for the numbers 0 to 9, plus, minus, multiply, divide and equals.
2. The user should be able to press buttons to create their calculation.
3. It should output the correct result when they press equals.

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Use a grid to lay out the buttons.
> - Create a buttonChoice subroutine or similar that takes in the value of the numeric button clicked, casts it to an int and displays it in the label.
> - Create an operatorChoice sub that selects which operator to display and use.
> - Investigate the `lambda` command for your buttons.
> - Use a `calc` subroutine with global variables for `answer`, `last_number` and `operator`.
