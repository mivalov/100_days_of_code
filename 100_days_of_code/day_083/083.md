# Challenge for Day 83

## Custom themes

Today's challenge is to add custom themes to your blogging engine code from Day 77.

1. Go and get your code from Day 77. This should include the template html file.
2. Add `get` requests to it, so that if I pass in the variable `theme` and a theme name I can change the theme to one of at least two different options.
3. Each theme should be visually different in at least one color, but go to town if you're feeling creative.
4. If I don't pass in any variables, the system should load the default theme.

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - You can specify more than one method at a time inside square brackets, so you could use `["GET", "POST"]`.
