# Challenge for Day 20

## Number Generator

Ask the user to list a starting number, ending number, and increment to use. Display an answer based on the user's answers (use the `input` command).

### Example

```text
List Generator

Start at: 200
End before: 300
Increment between values: 20

200
220
240
260
280
```

> Hints: 
> - Since you are using numbers, what else do you need to add when using `input`?
> - Define your variables as letters that can be placeholders in the range for the user's answers.
