# Challenge for Day 1

## Project 1: Print into the World

Let's get started with your first project! After only one day, you already have something you can share with the world.

_You can continue to use this same repl for your project. Just make sure you delete any previous code from our practice session._

### 1. Write your `name` and `today's date` in separate lines of code.

> Hint:
> Don't forget `""` and `()` when creating your print statements.

### 2. Copy this text below. See if you can do it with just one `print` statement!

```text
I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happend to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
```

> Hint:
> Remember you can use triple quotes for a large block of text. `"""`

### 3. On the next line add `I am feeling` with an emoji of your choice to illustrate how you're feeling about the challenge

### 4. Add one more line to your output `You can follow my progress at replit.com/@` and add in your Replit username. This will be a great way of maintaining accountability for yourself!

### 5. `Run` your program.
