# Challenge for Day 10

## Extend your bill calculator

Add a tip function that adds the total tip to the bill before splitting it equally between the people.

1. Ask the user for the total bill amount.
2. Ask what % of tip they will leave to be added to the bill total.
    > Hint: Typically, a tip is either 15%, 18% or 20% of the total bill.
3. Figure out how to get the total bill with tip then add that to original amount.
    > Hint: Divide the tip percentage by 100, and multiply that to the total bill amount BEFORE adding that to the original amount.
4. Ask the user how many people are splitting the bill and divide by the total.

### You can use the same code to get started:

```python
my_bill = float(input('What was the bill?: '))
number_of_people = int(input('How many people?: '))
answer = my_bill / number_of_people
print('You all owe', answer)
```
