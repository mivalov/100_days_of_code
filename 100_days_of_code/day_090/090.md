# Challenge for Day 90

## JSON

Today's challenge is to use the code you've just seen to pull in data for 10 users using [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) again.

Your program should:

1. Save the medium quality version of the profile pic as a local file named `{firstName}_{lastName}.jpg`.
2. Each picture should be saved to a different file.

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Use a for loop to send 10 requests, eg: `for person in user["results"]:`
