# Challenge for Day 46

## MokeBeast Generator (Part 2)

Today, you're going to program a full on MokÃ©beast MokÃ©dex. Yep, think we're getting away with it so far...

Don't forget, you can reuse your code from Day 42 here.

Your MokÃ©dex should:

1. Store multiple MokÃ©beasts using a loop.
2. Get user input of the beasts' details.
3. Add the details to a 2D dictionary.
4. Repeat until the user wants to stop.
5. Output the full MokÃ©dex using a prettyPrint() function.

### Example:

```text
ðŸŒŸMokeBeast GeneratorðŸŒŸ

Input the beast name > PikaWho?

Input the beast element > Air

Input the beast special move > Shaved fish

Input the beast starting HP > 50

Input the beast starting MP > 50

Again? y/n > n

name: PikaWho? |  element: Air  |  special move: Shaved Fish  |  HP: 50  | MP: 50
```

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Not much here you can't get from the examples on pages 1 and 2 for today.
> - Think about what you can add to make the spacing look nice? (fstrings, `>`, etc.)
