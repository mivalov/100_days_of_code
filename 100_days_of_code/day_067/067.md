# Challenge for Day 67

## Guess who

I've provided you with a folder called "Guess Who" containing images of 4 people.

Your program should:

1. Prompt the user to input a name.
2. If the user inputs 'Charlotte', 'Gerald', 'Kate' or 'Mo', then their image should load.
3. Otherwise, an 'image not found' message should display.

### Example:

![Example](example.png)

> ðŸ’¡ Hints
> - Pass the user input into the 'newImage' variable
> - Use `try ... except` to load the image or generate the error.
