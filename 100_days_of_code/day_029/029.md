# Challenge for Day 29

## Print

Write a subroutine that writes text in color. All it will do is print out the text in that color and turn the color back to normal when it's finished.

Control end and sep so there are not random symbols or spaces.

Check out [this github resource](https://gist.github.com/rene-d/9e584a7dd2935d0f461904b9f2950007) for the color codes.

### Example:

```text
Super Subroutine

WIth my new program I can just call red("and") and that word will appear in the colour I set it to.

With no weird gaps.

Epic.
```

> Hints:
> - Create a subroutine with a variable for 'word' and 'color' through the use of `if` statements. Here is an example of how to include the color red:

```python
if colour == 'red':
    print("\033[31m", word, sep="", end="")
```
> - `print` your title 'Super Subroutine' and 'with my' as regular `print` statements.
> - `print` the rest of the text in different colors by calling the subroutine.
