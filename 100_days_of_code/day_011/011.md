# Challenge for Day 11

## How many seconds are in a year?

Use the power of breaking a program down into its parts.
We could Google this, but why not make a program for this instead.

### Conversions
```text
60 seconds = 1 minute

60 minutes = 1 hour

24 hours = 1 day

31 days = 1 month

12 months = 1 year

365 days = 1 year

366 day = 1 leap year (this is every four years)
```

1. You can multiply a bunch of numbers to figure out how many seconds are in a year
    > Hint: Think about how the math would be different for a leap year.
2. Use `input` and `if` statements to add the extra day for leap year.
    > Hint: Think about if you need `int` or `float` for your `input`.
3. Make the computer do all the hard work and math for your. You do the thinking beforehand.
