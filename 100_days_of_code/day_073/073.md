You should:

1. Pick some of your best projects from the previous 72 days.
2. Create a webpage with the title 'My Portfolio'
3. Add the heading 'Your Name - Portfolio'
4. Each of the days you are going to showcase should have:
   - A second level heading
   - A paragraph of explainer text.
   - An image of each of your repls
   - Each image should be directly linked to the repl.

> Hints:
> - Use an `<a>` tag around the `<img>` tag to create the linked image.
> - Windows button + shift + 's' quick launches the snipping tool. 😁
