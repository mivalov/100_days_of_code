# Challenge for Day 51

## Improved ToDO Management System

Remember the early days when all this was just lists?

Good! Get back over to Day 45 and grab your to-do list code. You'll need it today.

Improve your to-do list to add auto-save and auto-load.

That's it. Go get 'em, tiger!

> ðŸ’¡ Hints:
> - Nothing today, just look back at the lesson and add the relevant code sections to your 'to do' program.
