# Challenge for Day 8

## Affirmations (or insults) Generator

Today's focus is using all the skills you have learned so far:
- input and output
- concatenation
- if statements
- nested if statements

### Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a customised affirmation each day of the week.

1. Make sure you ask the user for their name, the current day of the week, and a few of their favourite things. All of this information should be used to help you build your affirmations.
    > Hint: Think of these as variables.
2. The goal is to generate a unique message for each day of the week based on the user's answers.
    > Hint: use `if` and nested `if` statements
3. Use concatenation to generate the affirmation.
4. If affirmations are not your jam, then you could do a daily joke or insult. Please don't be mean. Keep it light and funny.
5. Final challenge: Can you create if statements that do not care about capital or lowercase letters of names.
    > Hint: Don't forget to restate the full question. `name ==`. The next chapter will explain this.
