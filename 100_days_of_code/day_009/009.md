1. Have a user type in the year they were born.
    > Hint: Think about what inequality symbols you need to use. You will also need `and` and `()` when looking at ranges of numbers.
2. Use their answer to tell them the generation they are a part of.
    > Hint: You will use `if` statements and `int` for this project.
3. Add emojis or a fun statement to go along with the answers if you like.

### Example:
